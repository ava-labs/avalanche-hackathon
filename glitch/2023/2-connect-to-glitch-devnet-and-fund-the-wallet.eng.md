# Connect to Glitch Hackathon DEVNET and fund the wallet

_In the world of Avalanche, we refer to short-lived, test Subnets as Devnets._ (source [HyperSDK](https://github.com/ava-labs/hypersdk/blob/0907bf7c016c3ab569952201270e37cdfb8592b1/examples/tokenvm/DEVNETS.md))

Ava Labs already set up a dedicated Glitch Hackathon subnet (DEVNET) using [subnet-evm](https://github.com/ava-labs/subnet-evm).

## RPC URL

The RPC URL of the Glitch Hackathon subnet is:

```bash
# copy this for examples here
export EVM_CHAIN_RPC_URL=TODO
